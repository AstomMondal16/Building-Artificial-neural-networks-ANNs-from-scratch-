# Building-Artificial-neural-networks-ANNs-from-scratch-
This repository contains a custom implementation of a neural network to predict kidney stone cases using a dataset. The neural network is built from scratch in Python without the use of any deep learning frameworks. It supports adding multiple layers, forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates.

## Features

- **Custom Neural Network Implementation**:
  - Supports multiple layers with configurable sizes.
  - Implements sigmoid activation function and its derivative.
  - Includes methods for forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.

- **Dataset**:
  - Uses the `kidney-stone-dataset.csv` for predictions.
  - Automatically handles missing data and splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Calculates accuracy on the test set.
  - Displays training loss during the training process.
